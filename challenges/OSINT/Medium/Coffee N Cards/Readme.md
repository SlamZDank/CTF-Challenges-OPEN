The Witness: Before the accident happened, I was in the cafe playing cards and enjoying my coffee, and I saw a very strange-looking car driving down the street. I think the car you are referring to is the one that was involved in the accident, I hope it was a minor one.   
Can you go and possibly find the time when the accident happened (hh:mm) in the md5 hash?
